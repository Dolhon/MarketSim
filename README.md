# MarketSim
Queue simulator

This simulator can be used as a tool to estimate the amount of service and space needed to meet the demand. Including amount of cash register, space for the queues and the amount of staff at given time. See how customer density affects the queue length and the maximum waiting time.

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to make a working cash register queue simulator even better by refreshing old project to more representative state. Which will showcase development skills to future employers. The aim is also to gain experience in graphical user interface design and development in Qt.

Project originally started in 2013 and was part of object-oriented programming 2 and algorithms courses. Simulation was first created in excel, then created as C++ console application and finally bolted into Qt for graphical user interface. The original project had problems with Qt and knowledge about Qt was lacking.

The objective of the simulator is to see how the density of customers affects to queue length and the maximum waiting time. Also to create a rule which keeps the maximum waiting time in given tolerances by increasing and decreasing the amount of opened cash registers. This simulator can be used as a tool to estimate the amount of service and space needed to meet the demand. Including amount of cash register, space for the queues and the amount of staff at given time.

This project doesnâ€™t concentrate in the algorithm, but more to improving the user experience. This includes localization, improving the Qt implementations and making the graphical user interface to work in real-time.

Situation


Problem of demand and service.

Simulation tries to answer on how the density of customers affects to queue length and the maximum waiting time. Simulation tries to create a rule which keeps the maximum waiting time in given tolerances by increasing and decreasing the amount of opened cash registers.
